# Sunscreen-Visualization

Data visualization is the primary means by which we can communicate data with one another. In fact, effective methods for illustrating data has been shown to improve people's ability to derive results and draw accurate conclusions from different types of data sets.

In this project we've been tasked with visualizing and quantifying the efficacy of different types of sunscreen and how accurate the SPF (sun protection factor) claims are. Given the absorbance spectra of different brands of sunscreen, by visualizing the data and doing a small bit of analysis we can determine the correlation between SPF and UV absorption. One thing we might be interested in is why even bother measuring how well SPF correlates with UV absorption. Personally, I don't know. However, the smart people at the Skin Cancer Foundation do (https://www.skincancer.org/):

### Why is Ultraviolet Radiation Bad?
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is part of the natural energy produced by the sun. On the electromagnetic spectrum, UV light has shorter wavelengths than visible light, so your eyes can’t see UV, but your skin can feel it. Tanning beds also emit UV radiation. There are a few... 'fun' properties of UV radiation that scientists determined a long time ago:
- UV radiation damages your skin
- It gives you cancer
- The majority of melanomas are caused by UV radiation

This data set measured SPF effectiveness across a wide range of wavelengths. In particular, it measured how well different SPFs worked for both *UVA* and *UVB* radiation, two different types of UV light. Here are a few differences between the types of radiation:

- UVA Radiation,
    - Has a longer wavelength and is associated with skin aging.
    - Causes tanning and is often used in tanning beds. However, there is no such thing as a safe or healthy tan. My friend Mary goes to tanning salons. I should pass along this information to her.
    - Is connected to the ''broad-spectrum protection'' we see on sunscreen bottles
    
- UVB Radiation,
    - Has a shorter wavelength and is associated with skin burning. 
    - Penetrates and damages the outermost layers of your skin. Overexposure causes suntan, sunburn and, in severe cases, blistering.
    - Is connected to SPF on sunscreen labels. The SPF number tells you how long the sun’s radiation (including some of the UVA) would take to redden your skin when using that product compared to the time without sunscreen.
    
While UVA and UVB rays differ in how they affect the skin, they both do harm. Unprotected exposure to UVA and UVB damages the DNA in skin cells, producing genetic defects, or mutations, that can lead to skin cancer (as well as premature aging.) These rays can also cause eye damage, including cataracts and eyelid cancers.

If we didn't already have a reason to do some cool science, now we do.
